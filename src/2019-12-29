<p>I made it to the YMCA today for meditation. I was happy I went. Learned to eat a Lifesaver mindfully. The instructor gave out candy and smiley faces.</p>
<p>When I went to BN, the other customer gazed at me for awhile, more than was comfortable, but when I got home it made me miss that moment.</p>
<p>I remember when that other person near Bethlehem Pike gave me a big smile, but when I saw they had no teeth, I'm sure I must have frowned. I feel bad about that.</p>
