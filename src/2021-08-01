<p>Going to move into my new place Sept 7.</p>
<p>Not sure if I should bring stereo equipment, coloring stuff, etc so that I can focus on meditation.</p>
<p>Had gotten into a disagreement with family. I tried to be assertive.</p>
<p>Things are quiet right now.</p>
<p>Been reading Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratena (sp.)</p>
<p>Things are still uncertain for my October 1 shot.</p>
<p>We've been having some really nice weather. It was a real joy to go pick up mail yesterday.</p>
<p>I colored today</p>
<p>167</p>
