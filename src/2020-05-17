<p>One of my money transfers bounced and its been a big headache getting everything back to normal. I started meditating once a day again and taking a bath at 12 PM. Not meditating in the evening though.</p>
<p>What do I want out of life? Remember to be reserved in social situations. Remember to keep a holiness with yourself when you are alone.</p>
