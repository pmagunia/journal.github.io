<h1>September 13, 2020</h1>
<p>One important realization I had was that I haven't changed. Think of all the times I hid/unhid my Pinterest page.</p>
<p>I have a feeling my relationship with my sister is going to fall apart once they pass away.</p>
<p>Been exercising by walking 15 minutes indoors carrying 15 pounds. I feel alot better afterwards.</p>
<p>I guess I have to get a colonoscopy next year since I turn 45.</p>
