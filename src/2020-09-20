<h1>September 20, 2020</h1>
<p>Still planning on buying a house next year.</p>
<p>My ES 1040 Payment still hasn't been received. Its taking forever. It was alot of money.</p>
<p>Started working for Accruent again.</p>
<p>Shipping back my Chord Mojo. Keeping the battery charged is too much of a pain.</p>
<p>Its a nice sunny day today. I dusted my computer desks.</p>
<p>Its quiet outside today.</p>
