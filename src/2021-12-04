<h1>December 4, 2021</h1>
<p>Got a real bad case of the flu. I took PTO for two days of work. I am planning on returning Monday.</p>
<p>Bought a VGA switch so I can easily use one monitor for my work computer.</p>
<p>Bought a simple mixer so I don't have to hook/unhook 3.5mm sound cables.</p>
<p>Bought a tablet for mom on Black Friday. The delivery date is January 20.</p>
<p>My sister bought me two donuts since I did well on my exam. That was nice of her.</p>
<p>Did well on my final. Look like I'll have enough for the grade I need to get credit.</p>
<p>Overcast day here in the Northeast.</p>
