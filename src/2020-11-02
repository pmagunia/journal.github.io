<p>This class project for software engineering is causing me a lot of stress. I hope I can find my way through the code.</p>
<p>Met with Jordan a couple of times on Zoom. He seems like he's friendly.</p>
<p>I've been eating two meals a day. It seems to be working out.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have to go and get my shot. I think its on the right side.</p>
<p>My back is a lot better. Not 100%, but better.</p>
