<h1>July 11, 2021</h1>
<p>We're already 1/3 through July. In a couple of days, the summer quarter will be half over.</p>
<p>Worked alot of my narrative visualization. I incorporated into my blog.</p>
<p>Ami and her family will be here tomorrow.</p>
<p>Trying to focus more on my meditation.</p>
<p>It seems like sitting at the computer and hunger pangs and positively correlated, at least from my experience.</p>
<p>I enjoyed speaking with Elana.</p>
<p>May be I should take up coloring.</p>
<p>I had this theory that the more still you are, the easier is it for disturbance to pass through you without causing irriation. Kinda like light passing through a glass of water.</p>
