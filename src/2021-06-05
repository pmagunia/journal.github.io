<p>Family came over today.</p>
<p>Got to get my code ready for deployment for work.</p>
<p>My sister and her family is planning to move closer.</p>
<p>They are resurfacing our road. We had some rainy weather which delayed things.</p>
<p>Language can get in the way.</p>
<p>Who can be still 'till their muddy water clears?</p>
