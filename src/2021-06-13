<p>My sister is planning on moving to Lansdale.</p>
<p>Felt bad after I had lemon cookies and pizza at night.</p>
<p>The temperature has been mild lately.</p>
<p>Got two books about mildfulness, one of them a journal book.</p>
<p>Apple is finally embracing Hi-Res audio. About time.</p>
<p>Switzerland was on my mind last night.</p>
<p>162.5</p>
