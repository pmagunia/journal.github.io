<h1>December 11, 2020</h1>
<p>Had an interview with Nationwide IT Services today. It was a second interview.</p>
<p>I didn't know I would have to turn on my camera but we had a good laugh about it.</p>
<p>I feel like I had built repoire with them. Willy seemed really nice and so did Laurie.</p>
<p>I hope I get to join them.</p>
<p>I feel uncomfortable about it right now. I keep replaying it in my mind. I thought it ended on a bad note since I thought I had ended it prematurely and didn't say good bye in a good way.</p>
<p>Remember I would trade everything for liberation.</p>
