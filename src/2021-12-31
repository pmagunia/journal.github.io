<h1>December 31, 2021</h1>
<p>Meditated for an hour today. I told myself if I did that, I would pursue that life in the New Year.</p>
<p>Looks like I'll be able to do that after the 7th.</p>
<p>I'm wondering how much time I should actually devote to that life. I like to work and pursue my interests too. I guess the Middle Path should be followed.</p>
<p>Its been very cloudy and dreary for the past couple of days.</p>
<p>Need a sunny day.</p>
