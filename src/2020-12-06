<h1>December 6, 2020</h1>
<p>Finished the group project for Software Engineering.</p>
<p>I think Linked In restricted my account. That's absurd. It caused me alot of grief.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a terrible day.</p>
<p>Last week I had a good meditation session. I forgot to write that down.</p>
<p>I have to remember to exercise after lunch.</p>
<p>Today I am going to try not to eat anything after 12 PM.</p>
<p>I think I'm overheating. Got to take off a layer.</p>
