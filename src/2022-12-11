<h1>December 11, 2022</h1>
<p>Took my final. I should have enough for at least a 'B' hopefully. Scheduled to graduate this semester.</p>
<p>Went to the YMCA.</p>
<p>Tried to help mom out on the computer. She is shopping on Amazon now.</p>
<p>Had an impossible burger today. I like it that they don't put beet juice in it but the Beyond Burger still tastes better.</p>
<p>Been at my new place for almost 2 months now I think.</p>
<p>Made a boo boo at work with the calendar. I was able to fix it though. Be careful in the future Parag.</p>
<p>170.5</p>
