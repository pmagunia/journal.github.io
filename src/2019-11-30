<h1>November 30, 2019</h1>
<p>Worked on a website quite a bit. Meditated for almost 40 minutes. Took care of all my chores. Got the grade I wanted to on my sample exam. I may skip studying. Wondering if I should quit the program. I don't want to study anymore. Got to make my schedule.</p>
<p>In other news, yesterday, I had an experience when meditating. When I focused more, I got dizzy for awhile then it was pleasant. It was like a wave that slowly soaked me from head to toe. Make meditation my "Why".</p>
