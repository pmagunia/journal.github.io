<p>Getting ready for my Data Visualization final. I think I have an A right now.</p>
<p>Been spending time with my nephew and sister.</p>
<p>Things are quiet right now on the weekend here.</p>
<p>My cousin and aunt brought over alot of toys and baby things for my nephew. That was really nice of them.</p>
<p>Not sure what to do about house. I feel like its kind of late to do anything</p>
<p>Drinking some soy milk right now. The Nature's Promise brand is pretty good. Silk lost me as a customer.</p>
<p>Going to try to get into coloring again and music. Haha</p>
