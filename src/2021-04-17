<p>Submitted my first pull request at my new job. I hope it doesn't break anything. I've heard humorously that your new job isn't real until you break prod your first week.</p>
<p>My new glasses came in the mail today from EyeBuyDirect. I'm very pleased with the quality and aesthetics. Glasses used to be so expensive.</p>
<p>Making pizza today from scratch.</p>
<p>Going to get my first Covid shot on Tuesday.</p>
