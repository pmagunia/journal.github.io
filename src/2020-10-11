<p>My Audioengine N22 got delivered today. I can now listen to my headphones with the Qutest.</p>
<p>I don't think dad has that much longer. Mitubhai sent an oxygen machine.</p>
<p>Listening to my Sennheiser HD660S. It sounds good. The HD Tracks and Chesky Records samplers are pretty good. I wish all music was recorded like that.</p>
<p>I was about to signup for the Introduction to Meditation at the Insight Meditation Society but I'm skeptical because they are asking for money.</p>
<p>Its so hard to find a teacher.</p>
<p>I need to refine my schedule.</p>
<p>Published on North Penn Networks and my blog that I help Nonprofits for free. I'm hoping I will be able to make some connections in the community this way and help out some good causes at the same time.</p>
<p>I liked meditating today. I felt a sense of peace.</p>
<p>I want to live a simple life but I'm buying all this audio equipment.</p>
<p>Selena Gomez is playing right now (I'd Go Back To You).</p>
