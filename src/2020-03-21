<p>Still want to get my own place with a minimalist theme. I did apply for home loans at Univest and HVB.</p>
<p>Got an A+ right now in Cloud Computing Applications.</p>
<p>Meditating 2x a day and trying to work yoga into the practice.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is terrible for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Planning to attend the beginner's yoga class at MontCRC when classes resume.</p>
<p>I might be able to graduate next year.</p>
