<p>Did work for Fred today. The place I'm volunteering at is not letting me edit the website even though they mentioned I could during the interview.</p>
<p>I am going to meditate after I write in my journal. Just focus on meditation and work. Make meditation my priority. Even when things are good I need to make meditation my priority.</p>
<p>I need to exercise too. My legs get sore from sitting at the computer desk all day.</p>
<p>Feelings can be confusing.</p>
<p>I thought about getting an Uber to go to that meditation center every week.</p>
