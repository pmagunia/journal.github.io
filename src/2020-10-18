<p>I hate this group project for class.</p>
<p>I liked the Happier video that Sam was talking about.</p>
<p>Have a lot of back pain. Went to Dr Gaibler and he gave me prescription strengh ibuprofin.</p>
<p>Going to skip halloween again this year. My Pinterest account has been closed for sometime.</p>
<p>Got my AudioEngine N22 in the mail. It works.</p>
<p>I wrote Isha. Mom wasn't going to tell me she called.</p>
