<h1>November 11, 2021</h1>
<p>Today is Veterans Day. I wished Bert a happy Veteran's Day.</p>
<p>Thought I was going to study Text Information Systems today, but instead, I worked some on my website.</p>
<p>I am going to take a holiday tomorrow. I hope that Search API Attachments ticket doesn't fail.</p>
<p>Monday through Wednesday was pretty sunny. I went walking everyday at noon.</p>
<p>I don't feel too well today. I wonder if its because I have too many layers on.</p>
<p>Just had a cup of hot chocolate.</p>
