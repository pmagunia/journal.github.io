<li>- Lot of education and work accomplishments</li>
<li>- Meditate every day</li>
<li>- Pay taxes</li>
<li>- Have a good credit score</li>
<li>- Take care of the house</li>
<li>- Have a good relationship with my parents</li>
<li>- Have a job<li>
<li>- Juice fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>- Cook for my dad</li>
<li>- Take care of the things I own</li>

</ul>
