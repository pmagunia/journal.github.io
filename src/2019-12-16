<p>My sister from New Orleans is visiting. She made lasagna yesterday. There was a lot of smoke because the sauce and cheese overflowed the pan. There was too much Italian seasoning. I don't think I like Italian seasoning at all. I wish there was more ricatta cheese. Oh well. She is leaving tomorrow morning.</p>
