<p>Filled out a background check with the federal governement. It was painful. If I don't pass, I'm going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>I'm walking 15 minutes after dinner inside and also go for walks in the morning outside.</p>
<p>I think I'm burned out for my website. Sam was warning me about that.</p>
<p>My stamps still haven't come in yet. Looks like my pedal is delayed too.</p>
<p>Gail didn't reply for my request to use her as a reference. Pete said it was OK.</p>
<p>Its unfortunate how things from long past can bubble up and disturb us. My mood deteriorated after I remembered I got that legal notice when I put something for sale on Amazon.</p>
<p>There is no never-ending fountain.</p>
