<h1>September 5, 2021</h1>
<p>My move-in date got delayed.</p>
<p>Feeling irritable today.</p>
<p>Yesterday I ate eggs.</p>
<p>CS 410 is difficult.</p>
<p>Sent Fai and Mona a thank you card and photo for raksha bandhan.</p>
<p>Was listening to Breakaway by Kelly Clarkson</p>
<p>Found a neat song by Jewel but forgot the title.</p>
<p>I thought it would be neat to make it a vacation to go drive on the Autobahn.</p>
<p>Dusted my furniture. Still need to do it again.</p>
