<p>Settlement is less than two weeks away.</p>
<p>Ckeditor cleanup ticket was on my worry list. So was fear of crashing the website. I need to bring up automated testing in scrum.</p>
<p>Was listening to The Disintegration Loops dlp1.3. It was nice. That is the kind of music I wish I could make. Thinking about applying to Berklee next quarter.</p>
<p>I hope I make it through Foundations of Data Curation. That is on my worry list too.</p>
<p>My sister hurt her ankle. I wish she would get an x-ray.</p>
