<h1>October 4, 2020</h1>
<p>Got my Qutest in the mail yesterday. It sounds pretty good. A lot better than my microStreamer. Some tracks that weren't fun to listen to are now a pleasure.</p>
<p>I didn't have a good meditation session in the afternoon today. Too much noise.</p>
<p>I woke up at 4 AM today.</p>
<p>My sinuses aren't hurting too much lately, that's good.</p>
<p>I submitted an application to Adsense to display Ads on my blog. I imported a bunch of pages from Picostat. Who knows what fault Google will find this time. I hope I get approved. The site generator is Jekyll.</p>
