<h1>February 28, 2022</h1>
<p>Went to meditation yesterday. It was good. Its kind of difficult to sit still an hour but afterwards its definitely worth it. I think I may have mentioned it before but I kind of feel like "molassus in January" afterwards.</p>
<p>Also I did some meditation in the morning today. I counted my breathe pretty well...at least better than I had been a year or so ago. I'm going to try to set aside 45 minutes in the morning and evening for this rather than having micro sessions.</p>
<p>Continued to listen to Urban Dharma. I think that's one of my favorite podcasts.</p>
