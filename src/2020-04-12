<h1>April 12, 2020</h1>
<p>COVID-19 is still going on.</p>
<p>The weather has been in 50s mostly.</p>
<p>I've decided to give up on yoga and go walking every morning.</p>
<p>I woke up before dawn today. I think having 2 cups of chai helped me out.</p>
<p>The website is looking better. Tested it out on IE. Since Microsoft provides development tools for free it saved me the money of buying a copy of Windows 12 to test out my website.</p>
