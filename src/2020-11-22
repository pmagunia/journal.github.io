<p>I'm not sure I used my hand to pluck the guitar strings before changing the bridge and bridge pins so a lot of effort was lost. I still have a lower action so that is good. I hope I don't get any fret buzz. I still have that guitar shim if I do I guess.</p>
<p>Katie is not celebrating Thanksgiving much so I don't feel so bad.</p>
<p>Dad has been getting tired very easily. He uses his oxygen concentrator that Mitubhai gave him alot.</p>
<p>My measure stayed the same so that is good.</p>
<p>Group project is almost done.</p>
<p>Found a course I wanted to take for the Spring called Interactive Computer Graphics. Going to attend the Webinar to see what its about and how difficult it is.</p>
<p>Mom suggested we buy a phone for Ami but she said 'no, she already has one'. That was nice of her.</p>
