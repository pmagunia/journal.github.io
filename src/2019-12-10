<h1>December 10, 2019</h1>
<p>Passed my final exam in computer networking. I think I should have an A- in the course. I'm 1/8 of the way to a degree. I didn't study at all or very little I should say. I shouldn't have done that. That really could have jeapordized my degree. ProctorU was a pain. For some reason they couldn't make out my ID in the webcam. I met all the hardware requirements. May be I should have gotten a better webcam instead. I thought to reward myself I would buy Logic Pro. I probably won't even use that software. Don't buy it Parag. I should reward myself somehow. I think I will get one of those Beyond Burgers out of the frozen.</p>
