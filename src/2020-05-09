<h1>May 9, 2020</h1>
<p>Not following my schedule as religiously during off hours. I'm not going for my walks either. I don't know why I've have the change of heart. I thought about dropping out of school after this semester but I think I want to continue now. I hope the Cloud Computing Capstone will not be difficult but I suspect it will be. Dad and I are going to have pizza today. Mom is stuck in India. Ami calls more often. It's a nice sunny day here today but I'm not going outside. Grocery shopping has become stressful with the masks and arrows. Katie was talking about how she likes cream of wheat. I found a water glass for my tables. Not sure what else to say.</p>
