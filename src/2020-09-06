<h1>September 6, 2020</h1>
<p>Class started. Looks like its going to be a difficult semester.</p>
<p>I went without debating for something like two weeks.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I see someone beautiful walking outside I feel something. May be regret?</p>
<p>Do I want to get a house? I haven't been able to answer that question but I am working towards it.</p>
