<p>Instead of killing a bug I freed it outside. This is the second bug I saved.</p>
<p>I eat chicken noodle soup though.</p>
<p>Upgraded to Monterey</p>
<p>I think my database reduction ticket will work out. Keeping fingers crossed.</p>
<p>My Eve Room is working. Its showing a different temperature than my Accurite thermometer.</p>
<p>I cleaned the bathroom today, also did a lot of dusting. It felt pretty good afterward. Got some exercise too.</p>
<p>Its almost time for my shot. I hope Reenie's gift comes in time.</p>
<p>I'm feeling pretty good right now.</p>
