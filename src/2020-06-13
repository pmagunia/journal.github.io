<h1>June 13, 2020</h1>
<p>Yesterday I went to pull weeds in the front yard.</p>
<p>Sam should be back soon.</p>
<p>My sister is pregnant. Haven't called her.</p>
<p>Talk to mom nearly everyday.</p>
<p>Got a 50/50 on my first task for cloud capstone class. Don't want to work on the next assignment.</p>
<p>Been very quiet at work.</p>
<p>Still meditating.</p>
<p>The weather has been really nice.</p>
<p>Want to buy a house? I can't make up my mind.</p>
<p>Need to update my Illinois webpage.</p>
