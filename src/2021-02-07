<h1>February 7, 2021</h1>
<p>Still haven't heard anything about my job. My income is off to a rocky start this year.</p>
<p>Was trying to find a domain for my quotes site but then thought I would just make a subdomain out pmagunia.com.</p>
<p>I still want to have a lot of userful information for r-data. Other people might find it useful still.</p>
<p>Haven't gotten out of the house in awhile.</p>
<p>I felt good when I exercised today shovelling snow. Mom is really an amazing person.</p>
<p>Am waiting on getting graded for my guitar couse on coursera.</p>
<p>I feel a lot better now that I went out and exercised!</p>
