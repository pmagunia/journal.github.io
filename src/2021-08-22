<p>Going to be moving soon.</p>
<p>Celebrated Raksha Bandhan.</p>
<p>Printed some photos of the rahkhris to send to my sisters as a thank you gift.</p>
<p>Meditation makes me like molassus in January or like a snake in a piece of hollow bamboo. I do a loving kindness meditation to kick things off. I feel calm right now.</p>
