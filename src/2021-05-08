<h1>May 8, 2021</h1>
<p>Spring weather has been in the mild 60s.</p>
<p>Work has been kind of stressful of late. Finished one ticket, need to deliver another one soon.</p>
<p>We're having Indian food for dinner tonight (sabu dahna ne kichadee).</p>
<p>Didn't like the Impossible Burger I made at home. My favorite is the Beyond Burger. Their packaging is wasteful though.</p>
<p>Still meditating.</p>
<p>Got my Breville Milk Cafe in the mail. Sajad said his Breville didn't last that long.</p>
<p>Going to try to call Ferdad soon.</p>
<p>Tuesday I get my second shot for the Covid vaccine made by Pfizer.</p>
<p>Can't complain.</p>
