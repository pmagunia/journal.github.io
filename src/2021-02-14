<h1>February 14, 2021</h1>
<p>A couple of days ago it had snowed alot over night. In the morning everything was soo quiet. It felt so good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had a good meditation session. I was able to focus on my breathe for a good bit of my session. It felt really pleasant, for real. Towards the end I thought I was getting toward another stage, believe it. I tried to repeat the experience this morning but, alas, it didn't work.</p>
<p>In the end, nobody else can go with you.</p>
