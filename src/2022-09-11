<p>Work is going alright. Said goodbye to Gabe. Tomorrow is my first day at my permanent position.</p>
<p>Settled down at home.</p>
<p>Got a car. Remember that's its impermanent. Added a garage to my lease.</p>
<p>Went to the YMCA for the first time in many months. Recommended A Householder's Vinaya to Bob.</p>
<p>Going to try to return next week.</p>
<p>Saw mom and dad yesterday.</p>
<p>Had some corn. Feeling good. Things are good. Lot to be thankful for.</p>
<p>171.5</p>
