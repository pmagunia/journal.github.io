<h1>October 2, 2020</h1>
<p>The car battery died. Had to make so many Uber trips to get it up and running again. Dad untightened the stuck screw. He's really good with his hands and good at fixing things.</p>
<p>Mom and I made brownies.</p>
<p>Ordered an $1800 DAC. Now I'm homeless.</p>
<p>Put a lot away in savings. I think that's one reason I decided to splurge.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do about buying a house.</p>
<p>I told someone I went to the park at some random time. I think she was flustered. My thoughts go everywhere. Never happy with a good thing. Have to have better.</p>
<p>I did wake up at 5 AM today and I meditated for 20 minutes. Then I meditated again at noon.</p>
<p>I think the spiritual life is the only thing that will make me happy in the long run.</p>
