<h1>July 24, 2022</h1>
<p>Work is going good.</p>
<p>Thinking about getting a car. I suppose a monk wouldn't drive a Lexus.</p>
<p>I thought about waiting till September.</p>
<p>This weekend seems really long for some reason.</p>
<p>Been reading "Being Nobody, Going Nowhere" by Ayya Khema. Reading about the 5 hindrances right now. Just finished sensual desire, now I'm on ill-will. My teacher suggested it. She is going up to Barre for a month.</p>
<p>Thought that I should take the 5 precepts. What if I get an ant invasion? I think that's the only thing holding me back. I did kill a couple of gnats today in my apartment though. I had the opportunity to kill one that was near my finger reading but I didn't. I guess that's progress.</p>
