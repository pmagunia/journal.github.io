<h1>June 27, 2021</h1>
<p>My sister really is moving down the street with her family.</p>
<p>She is going to be living with us for a week until closing.</p>
<p>I'm never going to make it outside the house.</p>
<p>Summer officially started a week ago.</p>
<p>I need to get some exercise into my routine.</p>
<p>I made a bunch of hobbies in my reminders list.</p>
<p>Work is going good. We're going to be busy deploying in July.</p>
<p>Submitted paperwork to have my nonprofit incorporated in PA.</p>
<p>Its been more bearable in the summer with the booster fan.</p>
<p>Things are quiet right now.</p>
