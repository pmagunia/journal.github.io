<h1>May 27, 2020</h1>
<p>Been getting back into the routine of meditating. Today's meditation was nice though I didn't want to sit down initially. After I got started it was pleasant being inside my body. The cool fan was blowing. No pain. It was pleasant.</p>
<p>Been working on websites. Trying to get a blue theme for one of them.</p>
<p>Pulled some weeds Monday. My doctor said to get 30 minutes of sunshine, 5 days a week. I think the window blocks out healthy light.</p>
<p>Restored my computer from a backup.</p>
