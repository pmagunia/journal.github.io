<h1>January 24, 2021</h1>
<p>Went to downtown Philly to have my fingerprints taken for my job. Haven't heard anything about the IRS job in awhile.</p>
<p>Fred sent some work.</p>
<p>Bought a looper pedal for my guitar. Been practicing JP Lullabye and Blue Guitar Blues. I'm hoping I'll have something I can turn in soon.</p>
<p>There was a virus in TeamCity software which is the same company that makes PHP Storm. Not sure what to do aboutmy local computer. I started formatting the hard drive but then restored it. At night when it was dark I heard the Swoosh of the Mac mini as it reboot.</p>
<p>I had eggs for dinner today.</p>
<p>Not sure whether I want to buy my own house. I have to pass that background check first.</p>
<p>Its been kind of sunny the past month. Not your typical super dreary January.</p>
