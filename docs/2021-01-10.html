<p>Still haven't heard anything from Nationwide IT. I will get in touch with them if I don't hear anything by the 23 which would be the one month marker.</p>
<p>Waking up everyday at 6:30 AM. Its not that bad.</p>
<p>Made a lot of progress on my website. Right now I can't get that loader to disappear at just the right time.</p>
<p>I think I am learning towards getting a house. I saw a Toll Brothers house it looked really nice.</p>
