<h1>August 29, 2021</h1>
<p>Moving has been delayed.</p>
<p>Started making an inventory of things I own. When I saw all the things I had forgotten about, it made me want to use them again.</p>
<p>Got a 100% on my Quiz 1 and MP1.</p>
<p>I decided I'm not going to give up my stereo or alot of the things I own. I still had joy knowing I had them but I do need to get more organized so I don't forget about them.</p>
<p>My wisdom tooth is bothering me. Just one of them.</p>
<p>Marie Kondo sounded like a salesperson in the intro of "Tidying Up". I decided not to buy the book then.</p>
<p>I'm kind of curious about Our Town though. I think that's the name of the book Katelyn was talking about.</p>
