<h1>May 29, 2021</h1>
<p>It's Memorial Day weekend. My first paid holiday. I wonder how much vacation I have accumulated.</p>
<p>So far my Breville hot cocoa maker is still working. It didn't work too well when I added sugar but with the Ghiradelli Double Chocolate mix it works pretty good. I like that one because the ingredients are simple.</p>
<p>Gave a demo of some of the work I did. It went pretty good.</p>
<p>Data Visualization is harder than I expected. The lectures are pretty good.</p>
<p>We have record low temparatures here in PA (mid 40s).</p>
<p>The association is resurfacing our roads.</p>
<p>Been meeting with Elana. She was grouchy last week.</p>
<p>Going to try to do some indoor walking tomorrow. I think I'll join the center if I go three weekends in a row so that I can do the weight room.</p>
<p>My sister and nephew may be visiting soon.</p>
