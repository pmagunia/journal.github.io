<br /><h1>September 11, 2022</h1>
<p>Work is going alright. Said goodbye to Gabe. Tomorrow is my first day at my permanent position.</p>
<p>Settled down at home.</p>
<p>Got a car. Remember that's its impermanent. Added a garage to my lease.</p>
<p>Went to the YMCA for the first time in many months. Recommended A Householder's Vinaya to Bob.</p>
<p>Going to try to return next week.</p>
<p>Saw mom and dad yesterday.</p>
<p>Had some corn. Feeling good. Things are good. Lot to be thankful for.</p>

<br /><h1>July 24, 2022</h1>
<p>Work is going good.</p>
<p>Thinking about getting a car. I suppose a monk wouldn't drive a Lexus.</p>
<p>I thought about waiting till September.</p>
<p>This weekend seems really long for some reason.</p>
<p>Been reading "Being Nobody, Going Nowhere" by Ayya Khema. Reading about the 5 hindrances right now. Just finished sensual desire, now I'm on ill-will. My teacher suggested it. She is going up to Barre for a month.</p>
<p>Thought that I should take the 5 precepts. What if I get an ant invasion? I think that's the only thing holding me back. I did kill a couple of gnats today in my apartment though. I had the opportunity to kill one that was near my finger reading but I didn't. I guess that's progress.</p>

<p>Worked on my Phase II project for Data Cleaning yesterday using SQLite. I think I already have enough for a B in the class.</p>
<p>The beauty about rugburn and mosquito bites is that virtually nobody wants them. Who would want to steal them? Who would be jealous?</p>
<p>Moderation, Modest living.</p>

<br /><h1>July 9, 2022</h1>

<p>Solved a difficult revision reversion problem at work. I was so happy.</p>
<p>Listening to "Read the Tapes" right now. Listened to "Everybody Lost Somebody" quite a bit. That was on repeat for a week or two. Thinking about moving my stereo here.</p>
<p>Have a beard right now.</p>

<br /><h1>April 12, 2022</h1>

<p>Moved into my apartment. So far I like it more than living at home. Been meeting with Elana regularly. Saw Mitubhai when he came to visit. He was so nice to me. Sonie was not mad at me anymore. She talked to me a lot and dropped me off at home. It was a good family reunion.</p>

<br /><h1>February 28, 2022</h1>
<p>Went to meditation yesterday. It was good. Its kind of difficult to sit still an hour but afterwards its definitely worth it. I think I may have mentioned it before but I kind of feel like "molassus in January" afterwards.</p>
<p>Also I did some meditation in the morning today. I counted my breathe pretty well...at least better than I had been a year or so ago. I'm going to try to set aside 45 minutes in the morning and evening for this rather than having micro sessions.</p>
<p>Continued to listen to Urban Dharma. I think that's one of my favorite podcasts.</p>

<br /><h1>February 6, 2022</h1>
<p>Went to the Y today.</p>
<p>Been listening alot to Rev. Kusala's podcast.</p>
<p>Randomly, I thought of writing a book: "The Monks of Shasta Abbey". They didn't have any Google Analytics on their website.</p>
<p>It was a nice sunny day two days in a row.</p>

<p>Stayed with my breathe a whole 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Going to find my own path.</p>

<p>It was cloudy out but I saw a good bit of sun in the mirror.</p>

<br /><h1>December 31, 2021</h1>
<p>Meditated for an hour today. I told myself if I did that, I would pursue that life in the New Year.</p>
<p>Looks like I'll be able to do that after the 7th.</p>
<p>I'm wondering how much time I should actually devote to that life. I like to work and pursue my interests too. I guess the Middle Path should be followed.</p>
<p>Its been very cloudy and dreary for the past couple of days.</p>
<p>Need a sunny day.</p>

<p>Instead of killing a bug I freed it outside. This is the second bug I saved.</p>
<p>I eat chicken noodle soup though.</p>
<p>Upgraded to Monterey</p>
<p>I think my database reduction ticket will work out. Keeping fingers crossed.</p>
<p>My Eve Room is working. Its showing a different temperature than my Accurite thermometer.</p>
<p>I cleaned the bathroom today, also did a lot of dusting. It felt pretty good afterward. Got some exercise too.</p>
<p>Its almost time for my shot. I hope Reenie's gift comes in time.</p>
<p>I'm feeling pretty good right now.</p>

<br /><h1>December 4, 2021</h1>
<p>Got a real bad case of the flu. I took PTO for two days of work. I am planning on returning Monday.</p>
<p>Bought a VGA switch so I can easily use one monitor for my work computer.</p>
<p>Bought a simple mixer so I don't have to hook/unhook 3.5mm sound cables.</p>
<p>Bought a tablet for mom on Black Friday. The delivery date is January 20.</p>
<p>My sister bought me two donuts since I did well on my exam. That was nice of her.</p>
<p>Did well on my final. Look like I'll have enough for the grade I need to get credit.</p>

<p>Today is Veterans Day. I wished Bert a happy Veteran's Day.</p>
<p>Thought I was going to study Text Information Systems today, but instead, I worked some on my website.</p>
<p>I am going to take a holiday tomorrow. I hope that Search API Attachments ticket doesn't fail.</p>
<p>Monday through Wednesday was pretty sunny. I went walking everyday at noon.</p>
<p>I don't feel too well today. I wonder if its because I have too many layers on.</p>
<p>Just had a cup of hot chocolate.</p>

<p>Not much news.</p>
<p>The midterm was difficult for Text Information Systems.</p>
<p>I created a recommender system for class. I got stuck on creating the Chrome extension but managed to get unstuck.</p>
<p>Work is going alright. One of my tickets got pulled from the release. I think I found out what was wrong with it though.</p>

<br /><h1>September 19, 2021</h1>
<p>I saw a deformed face of a person on Facebook today. I think they had been the victim of an acid attack. They were holding up a small white flower saying it was their birthday.</p>
<p>I thought about it again tonite listening to music and I started crying.</p>
<p>I feel better now. It makes me feel like any sadness in my life is unjustified considering all the good things in it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I cry for the animals in the labs too. I saw the end of a Nova PBS show about that. I need to find that DVD.</p>
<p>I usually don't cry but it feels good in a way. I don't know; I feel like I have some kind of bond with them.</p>

<br /><h1>August 29, 2021</h1>
<p>Moving has been delayed.</p>
<p>Started making an inventory of things I own. When I saw all the things I had forgotten about, it made me want to use them again.</p>
<p>Got a 100% on my Quiz 1 and MP1.</p>
<p>I decided I'm not going to give up my stereo or alot of the things I own. I still had joy knowing I had them but I do need to get more organized so I don't forget about them.</p>
<p>My wisdom tooth is bothering me. Just one of them.</p>
<p>Marie Kondo sounded like a salesperson in the intro of "Tidying Up". I decided not to buy the book then.</p>
<p>I'm kind of curious about Our Town though. I think that's the name of the book Katelyn was talking about.</p>

<p>Worked alot of my narrative visualization. I incorporated into my blog.</p>
<p>Ami and her family will be here tomorrow.</p>
<p>Trying to focus more on my meditation.</p>
<p>It seems like sitting at the computer and hunger pangs and positively correlated, at least from my experience.</p>
<p>I enjoyed speaking with Elana.</p>
<p>May be I should take up coloring.</p>

<p>It's Memorial Day weekend. My first paid holiday. I wonder how much vacation I have accumulated.</p>
<p>So far my Breville hot cocoa maker is still working. It didn't work too well when I added sugar but with the Ghiradelli Double Chocolate mix it works pretty good. I like that one because the ingredients are simple.</p>
<p>Gave a demo of some of the work I did. It went pretty good.</p>
<p>Data Visualization is harder than I expected. The lectures are pretty good.</p>
<p>We have record low temparatures here in PA (mid 40s).</p>
<p>The association is resurfacing our roads.</p>
<p>Been meeting with Elana. She was grouchy last week.</p>
<p>Going to try to do some indoor walking tomorrow. I think I'll join the center if I go three weekends in a row so that I can do the weight room.</p>
<p>My sister and nephew may be visiting soon.</p>

<p>Spring weather has been in the mild 60s.</p>
<p>Work has been kind of stressful of late. Finished one ticket, need to deliver another one soon.</p>
<p>We're having Indian food for dinner tonight (sabu dahna ne kichadee).</p>
<p>Didn't like the Impossible Burger I made at home. My favorite is the Beyond Burger. Their packaging is wasteful though.</p>

<br /><h1>February 14, 2021</h1>
<p>A couple of days ago it had snowed alot over night. In the morning everything was soo quiet. It felt so good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had a good meditation session. I was able to focus on my breathe for a good bit of my session. It felt really pleasant, for real. Towards the end I thought I was getting toward another stage, believe it. I tried to repeat the experience this morning but, alas, it didn't work.</p>
<p>In the end, nobody else can go with you.</p>

<p>Went to downtown Philly to have my fingerprints taken for my job. Haven't heard anything about the IRS job in awhile.</p>
<p>Fred sent some work.</p>
<p>Bought a looper pedal for my guitar. Been practicing JP Lullabye and Blue Guitar Blues. I'm hoping I'll have something I can turn in soon.</p>
<p>There was a virus in TeamCity software which is the same company that makes PHP Storm. Not sure what to do aboutmy local computer. I started formatting the hard drive but then restored it. At night when it was dark I heard the Swoosh of the Mac mini as it reboot.</p>
<p>I had eggs for dinner today.</p>
<p>Not sure whether I want to buy my own house. I have to pass that background check first.</p>
<p>Its been kind of sunny the past month. Not your typical super dreary January.</p>

<p>Filled out a background check with the federal governement. It was painful. If I don't pass, I'm going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>I'm walking 15 minutes after dinner inside and also go for walks in the morning outside.</p>
<p>I think I'm burned out for my website. Sam was warning me about that.</p>
<p>My stamps still haven't come in yet. Looks like my pedal is delayed too.</p>
<p>Gail didn't reply for my request to use her as a reference. Pete said it was OK.</p>
<p>Its unfortunate how things from long past can bubble up and disturb us. My mood deteriorated after I remembered I got that legal notice when I put something for sale on Amazon.</p>

<p>I feel like I had built repoire with them. Willy seemed really nice and so did Laurie.</p>
<p>I hope I get to join them.</p>
<p>I feel uncomfortable about it right now. I keep replaying it in my mind. I thought it ended on a bad note since I thought I had ended it prematurely and didn't say good bye in a good way.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I used my hand to pluck the guitar strings before changing the bridge and bridge pins so a lot of effort was lost. I still have a lower action so that is good. I hope I don't get any fret buzz. I still have that guitar shim if I do I guess.</p>
<p>Katie is not celebrating Thanksgiving much so I don't feel so bad.</p>
<p>Dad has been getting tired very easily. He uses his oxygen concentrator that Mitubhai gave him alot.</p>
<p>My measure stayed the same so that is good.</p>
<p>Group project is almost done.</p>
<p>Found a course I wanted to take for the Spring called Interactive Computer Graphics. Going to attend the Webinar to see what its about and how difficult it is.</p>

<p>I've been feeling kind of flat. Stopped the morning routine September 22.</p>
<p>Anyways my back is much better now, but I feel like I don't have much motivation. Feel like a jellyfish instead of a porpoise. I started creating a video of what my guitar sounds like before and after a new bone saddle and nut but my heart wasn't in it.</p>
<p>I don't have much interest in my website or career which used to be big motivators for me.</p>
<p>I'm sleeping alot like 12 hours a day and could sleep more.</p>
<p>I hope writing about my experience now will help me in the future.</p>
<p>I created a Google Sheet which summed up my pros and cons.</p>
<p>Today's meditation session was alright. There was a moment when I was able to stay focused and not go into monkey mind. It was a single moment but I stayed on the right path.</p>

<p>Listening to my Sennheiser HD660S. It sounds good. The HD Tracks and Chesky Records samplers are pretty good. I wish all music was recorded like that.</p>
<p>I was about to signup for the Introduction to Meditation at the Insight Meditation Society but I'm skeptical because they are asking for money.</p>
<p>Its so hard to find a teacher.</p>
<p>I need to refine my schedule.</p>
<p>Published on North Penn Networks and my blog that I help Nonprofits for free. I'm hoping I will be able to make some connections in the community this way and help out some good causes at the same time.</p>

<p>Ordered an $1800 DAC. Now I'm homeless.</p>
<p>Put a lot away in savings. I think that's one reason I decided to splurge.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do about buying a house.</p>
<p>I told someone I went to the park at some random time. I think she was flustered. My thoughts go everywhere. Never happy with a good thing. Have to have better.</p>
<p>I did wake up at 5 AM today and I meditated for 20 minutes. Then I meditated again at noon.</p>
<p>I think the spiritual life is the only thing that will make me happy in the long run.</p>

<br /><h1>May 27, 2020</h1>
<p>Been getting back into the routine of meditating. Today's meditation was nice though I didn't want to sit down initially. After I got started it was pleasant being inside my body. The cool fan was blowing. No pain. It was pleasant.</p>
<p>Been working on websites. Trying to get a blue theme for one of them.</p>
<p>Pulled some weeds Monday. My doctor said to get 30 minutes of sunshine, 5 days a week. I think the window blocks out healthy light.</p>
<p>Restored my computer from a backup.</p>

<br /><h1>May 17, 2020</h1>
<p>One of my money transfers bounced and its been a big headache getting everything back to normal. I started meditating once a day again and taking a bath at 12 PM. Not meditating in the evening though.</p>
<p>What do I want out of life? Remember to be reserved in social situations. Remember to keep a holiness with yourself when you are alone.</p>

<br /><h1>May 9, 2020</h1>
<p>Not following my schedule as religiously during off hours. I'm not going for my walks either. I don't know why I've have the change of heart. I thought about dropping out of school after this semester but I think I want to continue now. I hope the Cloud Computing Capstone will not be difficult but I suspect it will be. Dad and I are going to have pizza today. Mom is stuck in India. Ami calls more often. It's a nice sunny day here today but I'm not going outside. Grocery shopping has become stressful with the masks and arrows. Katie was talking about how she likes cream of wheat. I found a water glass for my tables. Not sure what else to say.</p>

<br /><h1>April 25, 2020</h1>
<p>I don't know if I should buy a house. Thought about trying to finish my degree early. Living around here would be expensive. I need a remote job. Do I want to move out of Pennsylvania? That certainly would open up possibilities. Got a call from a recruiter about interviewing with Apple but turned it down since I would have to move to Austin. May be I could research some places I want to move. I could potentially finish my degree by Spring 2021 or Summer 2021.</p>

<br /><h1>April 12, 2020</h1>
<p>COVID-19 is still going on.</p>
<p>The weather has been in 50s mostly.</p>
<p>I've decided to give up on yoga and go walking every morning.</p>
<p>I woke up before dawn today. I think having 2 cups of chai helped me out.</p>
<p>The website is looking better. Tested it out on IE. Since Microsoft provides development tools for free it saved me the money of buying a copy of Windows 12 to test out my website.</p>

<p>I saw someone at the YMCA. I wasn't sure it was them but thinking back I'm pretty sure. I'm planning to go back tomorrow, Sunday. I hope they will be there. I will definitely reach out to them.</p>
<p>What are the ramifications? Keep focused on your meditation.</p>

<br /><h1>December 29, 2019</h1>
<p>I made it to the YMCA today for meditation. I was happy I went. Learned to eat a Lifesaver mindfully. The instructor gave out candy and smiley faces.</p>
<p>When I went to BN, the other customer gazed at me for awhile, more than was comfortable, but when I got home it made me miss that moment.</p>
<p>I remember when that other person near Bethlehem Pike gave me a big smile, but when I saw they had no teeth, I'm sure I must have frowned. I feel bad about that.</p>

<br /><h1>December 25, 2019</h1>
<p>I opened the Christmas today. Dad wished me a "Happy Christmas" and I got a call from my aunt to at 8 o'clock in the morning wishing me a Merry Christmas. It was sunny in the beginning of the day but it looks like we have some cirrus clouds now. Not a white Christmas here on the East coast unfortunately. It's about 45 degrees outside. I'm setting up my homepod and imac right now. I hope the mac transfer ututility works. I don't want to reinstall everything. I went to see Sam yesterday. I gave her an Amazon gift card which I think she liked. I told her about family systems. It seems like a fascinating idea. I wished my friend a Merry Christmas by text message. He's doing well. I stopped drinking coffee in the afternoon and reduced my tea to half a cup. I think I feel calmer. I'm not going to bed earlier though. I tried to remember to not to "forget myself". Sam was drinking the tea I bought her for Christmas last year. She said she liked it which made me happy.</p>

<br /><h1>December 19, 2019</h1>
<p>Did work for Fred today. The place I'm volunteering at is not letting me edit the website even though they mentioned I could during the interview.</p>
<p>I am going to meditate after I write in my journal. Just focus on meditation and work. Make meditation my priority. Even when things are good I need to make meditation my priority.</p>
<p>I need to exercise too. My legs get sore from sitting at the computer desk all day.</p>
<p>Feelings can be confusing.</p>
<p>I thought about getting an Uber to go to that meditation center every week.</p>

<br /><h1>December 16, 2019</h1>
<p>My sister from New Orleans is visiting. She made lasagna yesterday. There was a lot of smoke because the sauce and cheese overflowed the pan. There was too much Italian seasoning. I don't think I like Italian seasoning at all. I wish there was more ricatta cheese. Oh well. She is leaving tomorrow morning.</p>

<br /><h1>December 10, 2019</h1>
<p>Passed my final exam in computer networking. I think I should have an A- in the course. I'm 1/8 of the way to a degree. I didn't study at all or very little I should say. I shouldn't have done that. That really could have jeapordized my degree. ProctorU was a pain. For some reason they couldn't make out my ID in the webcam. I met all the hardware requirements. May be I should have gotten a better webcam instead. I thought to reward myself I would buy Logic Pro. I probably won't even use that software. Don't buy it Parag. I should reward myself somehow. I think I will get one of those Beyond Burgers out of the frozen.</p>

<br /><h1>November 30, 2019</h1>
<p>Worked on a website quite a bit. Meditated for almost 40 minutes. Took care of all my chores. Got the grade I wanted to on my sample exam. I may skip studying. Wondering if I should quit the program. I don't want to study anymore. Got to make my schedule.</p>
<p>In other news, yesterday, I had an experience when meditating. When I focused more, I got dizzy for awhile then it was pleasant. It was like a wave that slowly soaked me from head to toe. Make meditation my "Why".</p>

<br /><h1>November 29, 2019</h1>
<p>Adding some work to a content management system I created yesterday. It's very basic, but I couldn't find anything text-based that was simple enough to use. Day One started charging alot of money for their journaling software. Everything on iOS is out to make money. It's starts off as free then once they have enough users they start charging customers. That's how it was with Insight Timer. I used to love that app. Then they started charging even for the individual sounds.</p>
<p>See me dancing with the MLA?</p>
<p>See me dancing with the M.L.A?</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is a tightrope.</p>
