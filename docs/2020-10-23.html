<h1>October 23, 2020</h1>
<p>I've been feeling kind of flat. Stopped the morning routine September 22.</p>
<p>Anyways my back is much better now, but I feel like I don't have much motivation. Feel like a jellyfish instead of a porpoise. I started creating a video of what my guitar sounds like before and after a new bone saddle and nut but my heart wasn't in it.</p>
<p>I don't have much interest in my website or career which used to be big motivators for me.</p>
<p>I'm sleeping alot like 12 hours a day and could sleep more.</p>
<p>I hope writing about my experience now will help me in the future.</p>
<p>I created a Google Sheet which summed up my pros and cons.</p>
<p>Today's meditation session was alright. There was a moment when I was able to stay focused and not go into monkey mind. It was a single moment but I stayed on the right path.</p>
