<h1>September 19, 2021</h1>
<p>I saw a deformed face of a person on Facebook today. I think they had been the victim of an acid attack. They were holding up a small white flower saying it was their birthday.</p>
<p>I thought about it again tonite listening to music and I started crying.</p>
<p>I feel better now. It makes me feel like any sadness in my life is unjustified considering all the good things in it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I cry for the animals in the labs too. I saw the end of a Nova PBS show about that. I need to find that DVD.</p>
<p>I usually don't cry but it feels good in a way. I don't know; I feel like I have some kind of bond with them.</p>
