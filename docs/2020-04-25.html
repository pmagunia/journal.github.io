<h1>April 25, 2020</h1>
<p>I don't know if I should buy a house. Thought about trying to finish my degree early. Living around here would be expensive. I need a remote job. Do I want to move out of Pennsylvania? That certainly would open up possibilities. Got a call from a recruiter about interviewing with Apple but turned it down since I would have to move to Austin. May be I could research some places I want to move. I could potentially finish my degree by Spring 2021 or Summer 2021.</p>
